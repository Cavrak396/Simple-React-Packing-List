# Simple-React-Packing-List
This React app was created as a practical test of my burgeoning skills and to familiarize myself with React technology. It serves as a simple tool for managing packing lists, allowing users to add, delete, and mark items as packed. Built using React's functional components and useState, the project is also an exercise in applying basic CSS styling.
